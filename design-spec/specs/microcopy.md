### Microcopy Guidelines

CTAs:
- "Add Student", "Create Assignment", "Mark Attendance", "Pay Fee"
- Avoid jargon; use sentence case

Empty states:
- Explain benefit + next step (e.g., "No students yet. Import a CSV to get started.")

Onboarding tips:
- "You can change your school logo anytime in Settings → Theme."
- "Set fee heads now to simplify invoicing later."
